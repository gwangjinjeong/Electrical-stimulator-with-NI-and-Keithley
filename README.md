Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) recording via regenerated motor nerves is a critical examination to evaluate functional outcome of nerve regeneration. However, there is not much documentation on the detailed method of CMAP recording via the peripheral facial nerve (FN). Here we introduce our new CMAP recording procedure in detail as a package including surgical preparation, data acquisition, and analysis using Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. A total of 8 male SD rats (weights 200-250g) were used. There were two groups; normal FN group (n=4) and FN palsy group (n=4). In the FN palsy group, the main trunk of the left facial nerve was surgically transected and repaired with one or two 10-0 nylon epineurial sutures. CMAPs from the vibrissal muscles were recorded before injury and 14 and 28 days after injury. We compared the peak-to-peak amplitude of CMAPs between normal FN group and FN palsy group. We also examined that CMAP recordings can be practically combined with the behavioral examination using facial palsy score and histological examinations.
